Each filetype icon has its own subfolder; single-icon file formats are available for Windows (`.ico`) and Apple (`.icns`). A global icon library (`.icl`) including all of the above is also present in the root folder.
The Adobe *Photoshop* original template (`.psd` format) may also be present.

Sizes 512×512 down to 16×16 pixels, at 32bits/pixel, 256-colors and 16-colors (EGA palette), with nonlinear scaling of graphic details (“opticals”).

Icons for the following ACES-related file formats are included:

 * **AMF** * *sidecar* file (ACES Metadata Format, `.amf` extension; specs under review)
 * **CLF** * color lookup table file* (CommonLUT Format, `.clf` extension; specs under review)
 * **ACESclip** *sidecar* file* (`.ACESclip.xml` extension; obsoleted by **AMF**)
 * **ACESclip** *manifest* file (`.ACESclip.xml` extension; cfr. specs [`TB-2019-009`](http://j.mp/TB-2014-009)); `.psd` available

Original design and optical-downscale adaptions by Walter Arrighetti.

Icons with * inspired by original sketches by **Frank Jonen**.
